      content: `Once upon a time, in a place far far away, the Prophet Mohammed (SAW) was born to a noble lady called Amina.
The night he was born, a bright star was seen in the night sky over Makkah.
Amina had a dream before the birth that the child should be named Ahmed or Mohammed. In the dream she was told that her child would be a mercy for everyone.
Mohammed (SAW)'s father Abdullah had passed away six months earlier.
Three days after his birth, his grandfather, Abdul Mutalib, took him to the Kaaba, to name him Mohammed, the praised one.
His whole family of Bani Hashim gathered to celebrate his birth. They fed many poor people.
Many miracles happened on the night of his birth:
In the palace of Kisra, the king of Persia, 14 of the palace balconies collapsed.
The Persians used to worship a fire. That was blown out.
A light from Amina came out which was so bright, that the palaces of Syria could be seen.
The idols that were kept in the Kaaba at that time, fell to the ground.
The Prophet (SAW) had a sign on his back which was called the seal of Prophet.`,

      content: `In those days, families used to send their new born babies to families who live outside of Makkah.
This was done so that the children would grow up strong and learn to speak good Arabic.
The lady Amina could only give milk to Prophet Mohammed (SAW) for only a few days. At this time, Halima had come to Makkah. She was chosen to be Mohammed (SAW)'s milk mother.
Halima was from a good family but they were very poor. Even the donkey on which she came to Makkah was weak and slow. She too was weak.
The day she took Mohammed (SAW), everything changed for her and her family.
Her health improved. Her donkey became strong. Her farm became fruitful.
Everything was filled with blessings.
Mohammed (SAW) grew up strong and happy, surrounded by the love shown by Halima and her family.
One day while the children were playing, Angel Jibraeel came and lay Mohammed (SAW) on the ground. Jibraeel (AS) then opened Mohammed's chest and took out his heart and washed it with Zamzam water from a gold basin.
He then removed a spot and placed his heart back inside.
Halima's children saw this and came and told their mother Mohammed (SAW) was killed. Halima rushed towards Mohammed and found him standing, looking very pale.
Mohammed (SAW) was only 4 years old at that time. Soon afterwards, Halima returned him to his mother Amina.
The Next two years Mohammed enjoyed being with his mother. Once while they went to visit his father's grave near Medina, Amina fell ill and passed away.
At only six years old, Mohammed (SAW) now had no father or mother. He was an orphan.
His grandfather looked after him for the next two years, when he too passed away.
Before Abdul Mutalib died, he put Mohammed (SAW) under the care of his son, Abu Talib.
Abu Talib raised Mohammed as his own son. Loved him dearly and protected him throughout his life.
Another very important person who looked after the Mohammed (SAW) like a mother was Umm Ayman. She used to work for his mother Amina. When lady Amina passed away, Umm Ayman took care of him and became an early supporter of Mohammed (SAW).`,

      content: `Mohammed (SAW) had to grow up very quickly. From a young age he started working as a Shepherd, looking after sheep.
As a shepherd Mohammed (SAW) learned patience and taking care of his flock.
Many of the Prophets of the past were shepherd's too.
Later, Mohammed (SAW) started to learn trading goods under the guidance of his uncle Abu Talib. They used to sell things from Arabia to the Syrians and buy things from there to sell back in Makkah.
On one of these journey's to Syria, a Christian Monk called Bahira, noticed a cloud was shading someone in the caravan of Abu Talib. He also saw trees lowered their branches to give shade to this person.
He invited the whole carvan to have a meal with him. This was unusual as Bahira would not usually do this. Abu Talib accepted the invitation.
Everyone came except Mohammed (SAW) who was left behind to look after their goods. Bahira insisted Mohammed (SAW) had to attend. So they went and brought him there.
The monk carefully looked at Mohammed (SAW). Looked behind his shoulders for the seal of the Prophets. It all matched what was written in his holy books about the future prophet.
Bahira told Abu Talib secretly, that this boy, Mohammed (SAW) would be a prophet, and he should protect him from harm.
Mohammed (SAW) was sent back to Makkah straight away so that no one could harm him.
Mohammed (SAW) continued trading throughout his life. He was very fair and trust worthy. He would never cheat or lie for making money. People started to call him a new name: Al Amin - the truthful or honest one.
Mohammed (SAW) later worked for a very good and rich lady of Makkah called Khadija. She observed how honest and hard working he was.
Khadija (RA) asked Mohammed (SAW) to marry her. He accepted and they loved each other very much. They had six children together.
The first child was Qasim: He died as a young boy.
Then there were four daughters: Zainab, Ruqqayah, Umm Kulthum and Fatima.
The last child was Abdullah: He died as a baby.`,

      content: `By this time, Mohammed (SAW) used to have dreams which would come true straight away.
He then got the desire to be alone. To think about things in peace. He was seeing a lot of evil in Makkah and he wanted another way.
While he used to go up the mountain, the stones and trees used to greet Mohammed (SAW) and would say "Salam"
Khadija, Mohammed (SAW)'s wife used to pack food for him for the time he spent alone in the cave. Often he used to give that food to the poor children.
One such day, suddenly, the greatest Angel called Jibraeel came into the cave of Hira. Mohammed (SAW) was shocked and surprised.
Jibraeel told Mohammed : "Read". Mohammed (SAW) Replied: "What shall I read?"
Jibraeel squeezed Mohammed (SAW) - till he couldn't breathe.
Jibraeel then released him and told Mohammed (SAW) for the second time : "Read". Mohammed (SAW) replied: "What shall I read?" Jibraeel squeezed Mohammed (SAW) a second time - till he couldn't breathe.
Jibraeel then released him and for the third time Jibraeel told Mohammed (SAW) : "Read!" Mohammed (SAW) Replied: "What shall I read?" Jibraeel squeezed Mohammed (SAW) a third time - till he couldn't breathe.
Jibraeel then released him and said: 'Read in the name of your Lord, who has created (all that exists), created man from a clot. Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous."
These were the first words that was sent from Allah, the creator, to Mohammed (SAW), for all human beings.
Mohammed (SAW) came down from the mountain and went home to his family. As he went home, he told Khadija: "Cover me! Cover me!"
After he settled down - he told Khadija everything that happened in the cave of Hira. Mohammed (SAW) was afraid and said: "I fear that something may happen to me".
Khadija then replied: "Never! By Allah, Allah will never disgrace you.
You keep good relations with your relatives. You help the poor and the needy
You serve your guests generously and you help any person who has troubles."`,

Khadija was the first person to believe in the message and messenger of Allah. She became the first muslim.
Then Mohammed (SAW) invited his family for dinner to share the good news. They heard Mohammed (SAW) share the good news.
Ali, the Prophet's cousin who was only 9 years old stood up and believed the message. Some of the older family members laughed at Ali, who was very young, for believing in Mohammed.
Abu Lahab an uncle of Mohammed was against the message of Allah.
Ali's father, Abu Talib, was the leader of Mohammed's tribe of Bani Hashim. He said he would defend and protect Mohammed.
In the house of Mohammed (SAW) lived Zaid, a boy the Prophet looked after since he was a child. Zaid accepted Islam. This made the Prophet very happy.
Abu Bakr, Mohammed (SAW)'s best friend, also accepted Islam. This opened the door for so many good people to join Islam. They are called the companions or the Sahaba.
One of those people was Uthman bin Affan, he was a close friend of Abu Bakr and he heard about Islam from him. He did not hesitate. He came to Mohammed (SAW) and accepted the message of Allah.

Mohammed (SAW) used to teach at a place called Dar Al Arqam. This was the house of a young sahaba called Arqam.
The ayats and surahs that was brought down by Jibraeel reminded the people not to be evil.
It also told people to be afraid of the day of judgement when everyone will be judged by Allah.
A lot of the powerful people of Makkah did not like to hear that Allah would judge them.
They became afraid that people started to believe in Mohammed (SAW). They felt they would lose their power.
One day the non believers found some muslims praying. They started to bully and beat the muslims. The Muslims did not fight back. Mohammed (SAW) taught them to be patient.
The Quran warned people not to cheat one another. Not to kill their children. To look after the weak, the poor and the orphans.

So they went to Abu Talib, the leader of Banu Hashim and uncle of Mohammed (SAW) to offer a deal.
They said, they would worship the invisible Allah one year and Mohammed (SAW) and his followers would have to worship the idols one year.
They also offered huge wealth. They offered Power. They offered the most beautiful lady of Makkah in marriage. They offered the best doctor, if he was sick.
Mohammed (SAW) rejected all their offers. Even if they gave the sun in his right hand and the moon in the left, he would not disobey Allah and stop the message of Islam.

The message was clear. They should only believe in Allah alone. Not the 360 idols. The Quraysh did not believe.
The Quraysh started to torture the weak muslims. Bilal was a slave to a powerful Quraysh called Utbah. He was very angry that Bilal believed in the one Allah.
So he tortured him - by whipping him and placing a big rock on his chest.
Bilal was in a lot of pain - but he kept saying "Ahad Ahad" which means One, One.
Bilal would only believe in One Allah and not the idol of Utbah.
One of the biggest enemy to Mohammed (SAW) and his message was an evil man called Abu Jahl. He found out that a slave family he owned had become Muslim.
This family included: Sumaiyyah (RA), Yasir (RA) and Ammar (RA)
Abu Jahl hated Islam. He tortured them. They refused to give up Islam.

On another day, Abu Jahl, took a rock to smash Mohammed (SAW)'s head while he was praying.
Suddenly, Abu Jahl dropped the rock and ran away. Later he said, he saw an Angel with fiery wings protecting Prophet Mohammed (SAW).
The evil non believers - started to tell lies about Mohammed (SAW).

Later Hamza, an uncle of Mohammed (SAW), just returned from hunting and went to the Kaba.
Someone told Hamza that Abu Jahl had insulted his nephew Mohammed (SAW)
Hamza was furious. He ran towards Abu Jahl who was sitting near the Kaba, and hit him hard with his bow on his head.
Hamza told Abu Jahl: Will you insult him, when I am of his religion and say what he says? Hit me back if you can!"
Abu Jahl was scared of Hamza and accepted backed down.
Hamza then went to Dar Al Arqam and in front of Mohammed (SAW) accepted Islam.
Hamza (RA) was known for being very brave and courageous. He was known as Asadullah, which means, Lion of Allah.
Hamza joining Islam, made Mohammed (SAW) very happy.
Another person who really hated Mohammed (SAW) was Omar.
He decided he would kill Mohammed. While he was going to Mohammed's house with a sword in hand, he heard his sister had become a muslim.
He was so angry and went to his sisters house. He saw they were reading the Quran. He asked to read the Quran for himself.

The King listened and said he would not allow the evil Quraysh man to take the muslims back in chains. They were allowed to stay in his country in peace and as free people.

Lady Khadija and the prophets uncle Abbas who were rich, provided food and support as much as she could. Their whole wealth was spent to help the people of Bani Hashim.
The Quraysh kept guards to stop anyone breaking the ban on Bani Hashim.
In the darkness of the night, Ali (RA) used to try to leave their camp and try to buy some food secretly. This was not easy and the people of Bani Hashim barely survived.

      content: `They returned with 73 men and 2 women to a place just outside Makkah to meet Mohammed (SAW).
Here they made a promise, a pledge, to defend Mohammed (SAW) and the muslim community, no matter what. Even if it means to give up their life for Islam.
These men and women from Medina are called the Ansars, the helpers, of Islam.
Allah blessed them with the greatest gift. The gift of Islam and the honour to keep Mohammed (SAW) in their city.
Soon after the pledge, the muslims of Makkah started to leave for Medina to protect their faith. This journey to Medina, the home of Islam is called the Hijra.
The Islamic calendar starts from this moment in time. The time when Islam found a home.`,

      content: `Mohammed (SAW) told the muslims to start leaving Makkah in small groups so as not to attract attention.
The Quraysh were unaware of the pledge given by the Ansar or the Hijra which had begun.
The Quraysh were planning to kill Mohammed (SAW). They were afraid of the blame of killing an innocent man.
So they devised a plan for one person from each tribe would be part of the group to kill Mohammed (SAW). The blame would be shared by all.
The Angel Jibraeel (AS) informed Mohammed (SAW) of the plan to kill him.
On the night of the planned escape, the Prophet (SAW) asked his cousin Ali (RA) to sleep in his bed as a decoy.
Then, the Prophet (SAW) left the house, and he recited the opening verses of Surah Yasin (36:1-9) and poured dust on their heads, as he walked past the assassins.
This was a miracle, the assassins were unable to see the Prophet as he walked past them.
The assasins fell into a sleep, when they woke up, they went inside and was about to put their swords into the person sleeping in Mohammed (SAW)'s bed.
When they removed the cover, they saw it was Ali (RA). He took the Prophet (SAW)'s place. Ali was ready give up his life for Mohammed (SAW) to leave Makkah safely with Abu Bakr (RA).
The danger was not over. The Quraysh sent groups in all direction to look for Mohammed (SAW) and Abu Bakr (RA).
Prophet (SAW) took shelter in Thawr Cave outside of Makkah. The Quraysh followed him there.
At that moment. A miracle happened. Doves came and settled in a nest at the mouth of the cave and a spider came and made a web across the opening.
The Quraysh group looked at the nest and the web and thought they came to the wrong place, Mohammed (SAW) could not have been inside.
Allah had protected the Prophet and his Sahaba once again when they were inches away from catching Mohammed (SAW).
It took them two weeks to reach the safety of Medina. It was a very hard journey.`,
